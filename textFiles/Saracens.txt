Zealotry

“ In the 7th century, the nomadic desert tribes of Arabia rallied around a charismatic prophet and established one of the most far-reaching and vibrant religious cultures that the world has ever seen. Lead swift cavalry and tough camelry to conquer from Iberia to India, construct strong navies to prowl the seas, and foster rich scholarship and religious contemplation. Your well-trained Mamelukes, fearsome and fearless warriors, are the only warriors strong enough to halt the advance of the dreaded Mongol hordes! ” —Description [1]

The Saracens are a Middle Eastern civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on camels and ships.

The Saracens as a civilization are also represented as the Abbasid Dynasty in Age of Empires IV. Because the Arab people were conquered by the Ottomans, the Saracens do not appear as a playable civilization in Age of Empires III (although several mercenary and outlaw units such as the Mameluke and Desert Archer use Arabic voice lines, with the latter using the same voice lines as Saracen military units from Age of Empires II).

Characteristics[]

Unique unit[]

Mameluke: Camel cavalry with ranged melee attack, and an attack bonus against mounted units.

Unique technologies[]

Bimaristan: Monks automatically heal multiple nearby units.

Counterweights: Trebuchets and Mangonel-line +15% attack.*

Civilization bonuses[]

The commodity trading fee is 5%.

Markets cost 75 wood.

Transport Ships have double hit points and +5 carry capacity.

Galleys attack 25% faster.

Camel units +25% hit points.

Team bonus[]

Foot archers have +3[note 1] attack against standard buildings.

Overview[]

The Saracens are classified as a camel and naval civilization. Apart from lacking the Cavalier upgrade, their mounted units are excellent, because they get all other upgrades, +25% hit points on their Camel Riders, and the very threatening Mameluke. On the sea, they get excellent Galleons that fire faster, and extra garrison capacity and hit points for their Transport Ships. Their archers get every single upgrade, and deal additional damage against buildings, making it harder to defend against a Saracen Archer rush. Their siege weapons are strong as they have everything except for the Heavy Scorpion, and Counterweights offsets this, as it gives their Trebuchets and Siege Onagers increased damage. Their Monks are good, as they have access to all Monastery technologies. Their Market bonus is very powerful, as it lets them exchange any resource for another for much lower cost.

Despite their well-rounded nature, the Saracens do have several notable weaknesses. The strengths of the Saracen Camel Rider does not completely cover the lack of Cavaliers or Halberdiers. The lack of Shipwright means that their late-game navy can fall behind if they are unable to match the opponent's production. Lastly, as strong as their Markets are, the lack of a clear and consistent bonus means it requires a lot of strategizing to be used to its fullest.

Overall, the Saracens are a very flexible civilization with a tricky but powerful economy bonus. They are also one of the best late-game civilizations due to their powerful Mamelukes and Siege Onagers.

History[]

“ The name Saracen applied originally to nomadic desert peoples from the area stretching from modern Syria to Saudi Arabia. In broader usage the name applied to all Arabs of the Middle Ages. These desert nomads erupted suddenly in the seventh century and established a far-reaching empire within a century and a half. Their conquest was fueled by faith and high morale. Following the teachings of the prophet Mohammed, their intent was to change the religious and political landscape of the entire planet. By 613 the prophet Mohammed was preaching a new religion he called Islam. Largely ignored in his home city of Mecca, he withdrew to Medina, built up a strong following there, and returned to attack and capture Mecca. Following his death in 632, his teachings were collected to form the Koran, the Islamic holy book. In 634 his followers began their jihad, or holy war. Within five years they had overrun Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. Their tolerance of Jews and Christians eased their conquest because these people had been suffering some persecution under the Byzantines . In the next 60 years, both North Africa to the west and Persia to the east fell to Islam. In the early eighth century, Saracens from Tangiers invaded the Iberian Peninsula and conquered the Visigoth kingdom established there after the fall of Rome . In Asia they took Asia Minor from the Byzantines and attempted to capture Constantinople with a combined attack from land and sea. The great walls of the city frustrated the land attack and the Saracen fleet was defeated at sea. In the west, Charles Martel of the Franks stopped a Saracen invasion of modern France in 732 at Poitiers . Frustrated in the west, the forces of Islam turned east. By 750 they had conquered to the Indus River and north over India into Central Asia to the borders of China. In 656 the Muslim world fell into civil war between two factions, the Sunnites and the Shiites. They differed on several points, including who should be caliph and interpretation of the Koran. The result of the 60-year war was that the Islamic state broke into pieces, some governed by Sunnites (the Iberian Peninsula) and others by Shiites (Egypt and modern Iraq). The new Islamic states acted independently, thereafter. Muslim Spain developed into one of the great states of Europe during the early Middle Ages. Muslims, Jews, and Christians lived together in relative harmony, and a rich culture rose out of these multiple influences. There was a flowering of the arts, architecture, and learning. By 1000, however, Muslim Spain had divided into warring factions. This civil war facilitated the slow reconquest of the peninsula (the Reconquista) by the emerging states of Castile and Aragon, completed finally in 1492. Asia Minor and the Middle East were conquered by Muslim Turks in the early eleventh century. In response to a call for aid from the Byzantines, a series of Crusades was launched from Europe to regain Palestine from the Turks. The independent Muslim states in the area lost Palestine and the Eastern Mediterranean coast to the First Crusade . In the last part of the twelfth century, the great Saracen leader Saladin succeeded in uniting Egypt, Syria, and smaller states, and he retook Jerusalem. The Muslim states remained independent long after the Middle Ages and eventually developed into the modern Arab nations of the Middle East and North Africa. They went into economic decline, however, when the European nations opened trade routes of their own to Asia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. ” — [1]

Trivia[]

The Saracens' civilization icon is based on the Rub el Hizb, an Islamic symbol, and the black represents the Abbasid Caliphate.

The user interface artwork is a calligraphic rendition of the Arabic word "Bismillah" (meaning In the name of the Lord).

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Saracens: Archer of the Eyes (alongside Ethiopians who represent Nubians), Imam (as per campaign appearance), Saladin, and Musa ibn Nusayr.

The Saracens are one of the two civilizations to get all seven technologies introduced in The Conquerors, the other being the Magyars who were added in The Forgotten.

The Saracens are one of six civilizations with access to all Monastery technologies.

They, alongside the Japanese, are also the only civilization that have access to all Archery Range units and technologies (with the exception of Elephant Archers, which are regional units).

The Saracens, along with the Dravidians and Japanese, are one of the three civilizations that have access to fully upgradable Champions and Arbalesters.

The Saracens are the only civilization capable of training the Knight-line that cannot upgrade them to Cavalier.

With The Mountain Royals, the Saracens and Persians become the first civilizations to have both of their original unique technologies changed.

Saracen overview (AoE2)

Notes[]

↑ The Saracen team bonus displays +2 in the technology tree, even though it gives +3 attack against the standard building armor class. This is by design, since the description is meant to tell players about the effect in practice, not the value in the data files. Archers typically do a minimum damage of 1 against buildings. The +3 attack bonus against buildings results in an additional 2 damage being dealt to buildings; hence the +2 in the technology tree.However, in some cases the extra damage is indeed +3, such as against buildings with low pierce armor (Outposts, palisades, and Gates). For example, a Feudal Age Saracen Archer (4 pierce damage) attacking an Outpost (0 pierce armor) deals 7 damage instead of 4.The Saracen team bonus affects Skirmishers and Slingers because they are in the same unit class as the Archer-line. It does not affect Hand Cannoneers, because they have their own unit class.
