Overview[]

The Dravidians have very strong infantry, with Barracks technologies at half price giving them an advantage in unit creation. Later in the game, Wootz Steel grants them an edge in their attack, and their Urumi Swordsman has very great offensive parameters. In addition to this, they have strong ranged units with fully upgraded Arbalesters and Hand Cannoneers, and faster-attacking Skirmishers and Elephant Archers. Their siege weapons have a significant wood discount and are tied with the Ethiopians for the widest variety of siege units. Their defenses are strong, lacking only Architecture and Treadmill Crane. In terms of economy, they have a strong early game bonus thanks to their extra gather capacity for Fishermen and Fishing Ships. They also receive wood upon advancing, which helps them in a variety of ways, be it building military buildings, producing archers or ships, or simply booming with multiple Town Centers.

The Dravidians have several big weaknesses. Their Stable units are lacking, with Light Cavalry and (non-Elite) Battle Elephants as their only Stable units, and none of Husbandry, Bloodlines, or Plate Barding Armor available. Although Medical Corps and Wootz Steel slightly compensate for their Stable, the former is too slow in its regeneration rate, while the latter does not compensate for the decreased durability, and is expensive, and only obtainable late in the game. Their Monks are also underwhelming, as they lack Redemption, Illumination, and Fervor.

Overall, the Dravidians are solid in both water and land maps thanks to their early game bonuses, strong foot archers and infantry units, and strong rushing and booming strategies.

Changelog[]

Dynasties of India[]

AI player names[]

When playing a random map game against the computer, the player may encounter any of the following Dravidian AI characters:

Amoghavarsha (ruled 814–878 CE): was a Rashtrakuta emperor, the greatest ruler of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. His reign of 64 years is one of the longest precisely dated monarchical reigns on record. Many Kannada and Sanskrit scholars prospered during his rule.

Govinda III (reign 793–814 CE): was a famous Rashtrakuta ruler who succeeded his illustrious father Dhruva Dharavarsha. He was militarily the most successful emperor of the dynasty with successful conquests-from Kanyakumari in the south to Kannauj in the north, from Banaras in the east to Broach (Bharuch) in the west.

Harihara I (also called Hakka): was the founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, which he ruled from 1336 to 1356 CE. He and his successors formed the Sangama dynasty, the first of four dynasties to rule the empire. He was the eldest son of Bhavana Sangama, the chieftain of a cowherd pastoralist community with descent from the Yadava race.

Jayasimha: was the first ruler of the Chalukya dynasty of Vatapi (modern Badami) in present-day India. He ruled the area around modern Bijapur in the early 6th century, and was the grandfather of the dynasty's first sovereign ruler, Pulakeshin I.

Kadungon (ruled 590–620 CE): also known as Thennavan, was a Pandya king of early historic south India. He is chiefly remembered for reviving the Pandya dynastic power in south India. Along with the Pallava king Simhavishnu, he is credited with ending the Kalabhra rule, marking the beginning of a new era in south India.

Krishna Devaraya: was a medieval Indian emperor of the Vijayanagara Empire, who reigned from 1509 to 1529. He was the third ruler of the Tuluva dynasty. He ruled the largest empire in India after the decline of the Delhi Sultanate. He became the dominant ruler of the peninsula by defeating the sultans of Bijapur, Golconda, the Bahmani Sultanate and the Gajapatis of Odisha, and was one of the most powerful Hindu rulers in India.

Kulothunga (1025 CE - 1122 CE): was an 11th-century Chola Emperor who reigned for fifty-two years. He also served as the Eastern Chalukya Emperor succeeding his father Rajaraja Narendra. He is related to the Chola dynasty though his mother's side and the Eastern Chalukyas through his father's side.

Maravarman I, also known as Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I (முதலாம் மாறவர்மன் குலசேகர பாண்டியன்): was a Pandyan emperor who ruled regions of South India between 1268–1308 CE. His death lead to the Pandyan Civil War in 1308–1323.

Rajaraja Chola (also called Rajaraja Chola I, born Arulmoli Varman) (947 CE – 1014 CE): often described as Rajaraja the Great, was a Chola emperor who reigned from 985 CE to 1014 CE and was the most powerful king in south at his time, chiefly remembered for reinstating the Chola power and ensuring its supremacy in South India and Indian Ocean. He also built the great Brihadisvara Temple at the Chola capital Thanjavur.

Rajendra Chola (இராஜேந்திர சோழன்), also Rajendra Chola I or Rajendra I: was a Chola emperor of South India (Present day Tamil Nadu, Andhra pradesh, Kerala, Part of Karnataka and Telangana) who succeeded his father Rajaraja Chola I to the throne in 1014. During his reign, he extended the influence of the Chola empire to the banks of the river Ganga in North India and across the Indian ocean to the West and Southeast Asia, making the Chola Empire one of the most powerful maritime empires of India.

Srimara Srivallabha (ruled 815–862 AD): was a Pandya king of early medieval south India. Srimara was famously known as the Parachakra Kolahala ("the Confounder of the Circle of his Enemies"). The Larger Sinnamanur Plates (Sanskrit portion) tells that Srimara defeated the "Mayapandya", the Kerala (Chera), the king of Simhala, the Pallava and the Vallabha. The Tamil portion claims victories at Kunnur and Vizhinjam as well as in Sri Lanka.

Vijayalaya: was a king of South India (reigned 847 – 871 CE) who founded the imperial Chola Empire. He ruled over the region to the north of the river Kaveri. The ancient Chola kingdom, once famous in Tamil literature and in the writings of Greek merchants and geographers, faded into darkness after 300 CE. Making use of the opportunity during a war between Pandyas and Pallavas, Vijayalaya rose out of obscurity and captured Thanjavur.

Vikramaditya I (655–680 CE): was the third son and followed his father, Pulakeshi II on to the Chalukya throne. He restored order in the fractured kingdom and made the Pallavas retreat from the capital Vatapi. He adopted the title Raja-malla after defeating the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, who was known as Maha-malla ("great wrestler").

Vijayabahu (born Prince Keerthi) (ruled 1055–1110): also known as Vijayabahu the Great, was a medieval king of Sri Lanka. Born to a royal bloodline, Vijayabahu grew up under Chola occupation. He assumed rulership of the Ruhuna principality in the southern parts of the country in 1055. Following a seventeen-year-long campaign, he successfully drove the Cholas out of the island in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century. During his reign, he re-established Buddhism in Sri Lanka and repaired much of the damage caused to infrastructure during the wars.

History[]

“ While the Guptas ruled in the north, the southern half of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by a separate series of dynasties. One, the Chalukyas (6th-8th centuries AD) expanded south from the Deccan plateau and formed a large but far-flung and volatile dominion. As time wore on, a new power came into being: the Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th-10th centuries), which formed a considerably more powerful state. For generations, the Rashtrakutas vied with the Bengali Palas and the Gurjara Pratiharas for supremacy in the so-called Kannauj Triangle. Alongside the Rashtrakutas rose another entity, the Pandyas (6th-10th centuries) of south India. Under able rulers such as Kadungon and Srimara, the Pandyas ruled much of the coast along the Bay of Bengal, engaging at times – not always by choice – in the Kannauj Triangle rivalry. The region that they ruled was a prominent node along a healthy trade network spanning the Indian subcontinent and its surrounding oceans. However, both realms nearly faced ruin and narrowly avoided catastrophe when the Pala Emperor Devapala launched an ambitious campaign to the far south to expand his already vast realm. The power vacuum and instability created by this and other events directly enabled the rise to supremacy of another great power, the Chola Empire (9th-13th centuries). Although based primarily in southern India and Sri Lanka, the Cholas, led by intrepid rulers such as Rajaraja and Rajendra , expanded their sphere of influence northeast to coastal Bengal as well as to Southeast Asia. In one notable conflict, Rajendra Chola allied himself with Suryavarman I of the Khmer Empire to crush Srivijaya, a maritime empire based primarily in Sumatra and Malaysia. The Chola fleet was among the most powerful of its time, being meticulously organized and well equipped. Comprising a wide array of vessel types, it could crush enemy navies in small-scale engagements or swarm and overwhelm them with sheer numbers. Southern India was also remarkably technologically advanced. One of its more famous products was wootz , a predecessor of modern steel. Dravidian weapons fashioned of this substance were stronger, deadlier, and more durable than their counterparts elsewhere. This technology eventually spread along trade routes to the Middle East, where it became known as Damascus steel, and finally into Europe. Weaponry from this region was also innovative in nature: one prominent example is the urumi, a flexible blade that was wielded like a whip. Urumis had an uncanny ability to circumvent defenses and inflict dreadful lacerations. As the Chola Empire declined, a second wave of Pandya dominance replaced it. However, at this time further adversities emerged: scions of the Delhi Sultanate now made regular incursions south in an attempt to conquer the remainder of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, a new power rose in response to these threats: the Vijayanagara Empire (14th-17th centuries). This formidable state harnessed the strengths of its predecessors, but would also import gunpowder weaponry from European merchants who frequented the region. Though successful for a while, Vijayanagara was eventually overwhelmed by the steady pressure of invasions from the north. ” —In-game section

Trivia[]

The Dravidian civilization icon is very likely based on the maduvu, a traditional Tamil defensive weapon, but without the horns.

The Dravidian emblem in the user interface shows Nataraja, a depiction of the Hindu God Shiva as the divine cosmic dancer. The symbolism has been interpreted in classical Indian texts such as Unmai Vilakkam, Mummani Kovai, Tirukuttu Darshana, and Tiruvatavurar Puranam, dating from the 12th century CE (Chola empire) and later.

In Dynasties of India, the Dravidians keep the Castle and Wonder models given to the Indians in Age of Empires II HD: Rise of the Rajas. The Castle is based on the Golconda Fort in Hyderabad with some influences from fortresses in Karnataka,[2] and the Wonder is the Brihadishvara Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.

The Dravidians have the least diverse Stable after the three Native American civilizations (who cannot build Stables of their own). They are the only civilization that can create Battle Elephants but is unable upgrade them to Elite, and they lack any Imperial Age Stable units. Finally, like the Vikings, they lack Husbandry, Bloodlines, and Plate Barding Armor.
Historically, the Dravidians, especially the Tamils, had one of the most powerful Elephant armies. Also, the Chola Empire had many elephant troops, and also utilized the elephant from Sri Lanka, which is suited for battle. The in-game Dravidians have the weakest Battle Elephant, as they not only cannot upgrade, but also lack both Stable technologies and Plate Barding Armor, which hinders their Elephant units' mobility and durability.

The Dravidians are the first civilization introduced in the Definitive Edition with fully upgraded Arbalesters.

The Dravidians are the first civilization with a unique naval unit to have a complete Dock.

The Dravidians are the only civilization to lack both Castle Age Mining Camp technologies.

The Dravidians are very similar to the Vikings, as both have powerful navy and infantry. They have a very weak Stable, but with Battle Elephants instead of Knights. They also have weak Monks, and both their naval unique units fire multiple projectiles. However, the Dravidians are good in trash wars.

Due to receiving extra wood every Age, having more efficient Fishing Ships and fishermen with a complete technology tree, possessing a team bonus that provides additional population from Dock, and getting Thirisadai as their unique ships, the Dravidians are one of the most powerful civilizations on water maps. However, they have much lower win rates in land maps because of their abysmal cavalry units, which make them extremely vulnerable against cavalry raiding. Nevertheless, because they receive a wood bonus whenever they reach new Age, the Dravidians get a significant economic advantage in the early game.

The Dravidians have the least horse-mounted units outside of Native American civilizations, only their Scout Cavalry line uses a horse.

The Dravidians are the only civilization that can never access the ram line outside of the Scenario Editor, as they are the only Indian civilization that lacks Redemption, which is required to convert siege units.

The Dravidians, along with the Saracens and Japanese, are one of the three civilizations that have access to both fully upgradable Champions and Arbalesters.

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Dravidians: Amoghavarsha, General Araiyan, and Rajendra Chola.

The Dravidians' naval unique unit (Thirisadai) and a unique technology (Medical Corps) were based on fraudulent information on two Wikipedia pages, the Chola navy and Chola military, respectively. The claims about them have been removed from Wikipedia following an investigation.

Behind the Scenes[]

“ The Dravidian civilization is based on the Dravidian language family. The term "Dravidian" encompasses 70+ different languages in South India spoken by a total of over 200 million people. This umbrella term in its original form (drāviḍa) is attested at least as far back as classical Sanskrit literature from the 3rd century BCE. In these sources, the term "Dravidian" generally denotes Southern Indian regions and their inhabitants. In later centuries, the term was also used to explicitly describe languages. While developing the Dravidian civilization, the immense variety and intricacies of ethnographic, linguistic, and geographic groups were carefully explored and evaluated to represent the millions of people under these subgroups. For example: the inspiration behind the Rajendra campaign comes from the period of the Chola Dynasty (4th century BCE to 1279 CE). Although the ruling class of the Chola Dynasty spoke Tamil, a member of the broader Dravidian language family, this region was filled with diversity in languages, cultures, identities, and more. Other significant aspects behind the Dravidian civilization design include but are not limited to the Urumi, a weapon that was developed in modern-day Kerala; a Castle based primarily on Golconda Fort in Hyderabad along with some influences from fortresses in Karnataka; and the numerous military, scientific, and technological advancements of the Vijayanagara Empire (14th – 17th centuries CE). ” — [2]
