“ On the edge of East Asia, an industrious and vibrant culture built on a strict system of honor and personal virtue blossomed and enthralled contemporary and modern observers alike. Brilliant tacticians led courageous and skilled infantry forces to stunning victories while ascetic monks fostered intellectual growth. The fearsome leaders of your armies are the Samurai, whose sharp blades can cut down even the strongest and proudest among the enemy forces! ” —Description [1]

The Japanese are an East Asian civilization in Age of Empires II. They are an infantry-based civilization, with their infantry possessing the fastest attack speed in the game. They are the descendants of the Yamato civilization, which inhabited the same island. The Japanese civilization is based on Japan in Asuka to Later Sengoku Period which was dominated by the powerful regional families (daimyō) and the military rule of warlords (shōgun) from 1185 to 1868.

The Japanese also appear in Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties as a playable civilization, which covers the Japanese from the late Sengoku period to the Meiji Restoration period. The Japanese also return in Age of Empires IV: The Sultans Ascend, which much like this version of the Japanese, covers the medieval era of Japan.

Characteristics[]

Unique unit[]

Samurai: Fast-attacking infantry with an attack bonus against unique units.

Unique technologies[]

Yasama: Gives towers extra arrows.

Kataparuto: Makes Trebuchets pack, unpack, and fire faster.

Civilization bonuses[]

Fishing Ships have double hit points, +2 pierce armor, and work 5%/10%/15%/20% faster in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.

Mills, Lumber Camps and Mining Camps are 50% cheaper.

Infantry attack 33% faster starting in the Feudal Age.

Mounted archers +2 attack vs. archers (except Skirmishers).

Team bonus[]

Galleys have a +50% longer Line of Sight.

Overview[]

The Japanese are an infantry civilization and command what is the most deadly infantry of any civilization, with all upgrades available plus a faster attack rate on their infantry, effectively giving them +33% attack, including bonus damage. The Japanese also have fully upgradable archers, including Cavalry Archers that deal +2 damage to all archers except Skirmishers. Kataparuto makes their Trebuchets much more powerful, as not only do they fire faster, they are significantly more mobile as their pack/unpack time was reduced. Their navy is solid, the absence of Heavy Demolition Ships being compensated by longer-sighted and fully upgradable Galleons. Their Monks are very good as well, with all technologies available. Yasama gives them arguably the best Keeps in the game, increasing the damage output of Japanese towers significantly. They have one of the best fishing economies on maps with fish as their Fishing Ships not only fish faster but are significantly more durable, a bonus that is especially important due to the lack of walling on water. Their land economy is worse, but still decent due to their discounted drop-off buildings.

However, the Japanese have several weaknesses. While their Knights are perfectly viable in the Castle Age, their cavalry options in the late game are poor without the Hussar or Plate Mail Armor. Their Siege Workshop units are unremarkable as well, missing Bombard Cannons, Siege Rams, and Siege Onagers. Both of these combined means that the Japanese can struggle to make an offensive push.

Overall, the Japanese are a civilization with a solid variety of options. This makes the Japanese an appealing civilization for players who can transition to other units after their initial infantry rush in the Dark Age or Feudal Age. Their simplistic and straightforward bonuses for their Fishing Ships and Galleys (combined with their cheaper Mills, Lumber Camps, and Mining Camps) also make them a beginner-friendly civilization to learn how to play in water maps.

History[]

“ Located 100 miles off the mainland of Asia, at its closest point, Japan was a land of mystery at the edge of civilization. Isolated at first by geography and later by choice, the Japanese developed a distinctive culture that drew very little from the outside world. At the beginning of what were the Middle Ages in Europe, the advanced culture of Japan was centered at the north end of the Inland Sea on the main island of Honshu. Across the Hakone Mountains to the east lay the Kanto, an alluvial plain that was the single largest rice-growing area on the islands. To the north and east of the Kanto was the frontier, beyond which lived aboriginal Japanese who had occupied the islands since Neolithic times. Some believe that by the fifth century AD the Yamato court had become largely ceremonial. Independent clans, known as uji, held the real power behind the throne. Clan leaders formed a sort of aristocracy and vied with each other for effective control of land and the throne. In 536 the Soga clan became predominant and produced the first great historical statesman, Prince Shotoku, who instituted reforms that laid the foundation of Japanese culture for generations to come. In 645, power shifted from the Soga clan to the Fujiwara clan . The Fujiwara presided over most of the Heian period (794 to 1185). The new leadership imposed the Taika Reform of 645, which attempted to redistribute the rice-growing land, establish a tax on agricultural production, and divide the country into provinces. Too much of the country remained outside imperial influence and control, however. Real power shifted to great families that rose to prominence in the rice-growing lands. Conflict among these families led to civil war and the rise of the warrior class. Similar to the experience of medieval western Europe, the breakdown of central authority in Japan, the rise of powerful local nobles, and conflict with barbarians at the frontier combined to create a culture dominated by a warrior elite. These warriors became known as Samurai, ("those who serve"), who were roughly equivalent to the European knight. A military government replaced the nobility as the power behind the throne at the end of the twelfth century. The head of the military government was the Shogun. Samurai lived by a code of the warrior, something like the European code of chivalry. The foundation of the warrior code was loyalty to the lord. The warrior expected leadership and protection. In return he obeyed his lord's commands without question and stood ready to die on his lord's behalf. A Samurai placed great emphasis on his ancestry and strove to carry on family traditions. He behaved so as to earn praise. He was to be firm and show no cowardice. Warriors went into battle expecting and looking to die. It was felt that a warrior hoping to live would fight poorly. The Kamakura period (1185 to 1333) was named after a region of Japan dominated by a new ruling clan that took power after civil war. The Mongols attempted to invade Japan twice, in 1274 and 1281, but were repulsed both times. A fortuitous storm caused great loss to the second Mongol invasion fleet. ” — [1]

Trivia[]

The Japanese civilization icon is based on kikumon, the emblem of the Japanese imperial family.

The user interface image in the Definitive Edition represents the icons of the Tokugawa, Toyotomi, and Oda clans, respectively. Each clan emblem represent the "three unifiers" of Japan (Tokugawa Ieyasu, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Oda Nobunaga respectively).

One of the Japanese AI player names, Tokugawa Ieyasu, appears as the AI personality and as one of the characters of the Japanese campaign in Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties.

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Japanese: Kitabatake, Minamoto, and Nobunaga. The Ninja is a Scenario Editor unit which is not used in any scenario in the game.

Alongside Saracens, the Japanese are the only civilization with access to all Archery Range units and technologies (with the exception of Elephant Archers, which are regional units).

The Japanese, along with the Saracens and Dravidians, are one of the three civilizations that have access to fully upgradable Champions and Arbalesters.

Before The Forgotten, the Japanese were the only civilization that was able to research Parthian Tactics, but not Bloodlines. After the release of The Forgotten, there are no civilizations in the game that can research Parthian Tactics, but not Bloodlines.

The Japanese are now the only East Asian civilization that have access to Redemption.
