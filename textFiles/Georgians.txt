Overview[]

The Georgians are classified as a defensive and cavalry civilization, and many of their bonuses are more defensive in nature, including their cavalry civilization bonus of slowly regenerating hit points. Their units and buildings receive -20% damage (-40% instead of -25%) when fighting from higher elevation. On top of that, they start with a Mule Cart, giving the Georgians a bit of a head start on their economy. The Mule Cart satisfies one of the two Dark Age buildings requirement for the Feudal Age. Their mid-game economy can be further boosted with Fortified Churches providing Villagers +10% work rate within the 10-tile radius. As noted, their cavalry are solid, with access to fully upgradable Cavaliers and Hussars, and their unique unit, the Monaspa, growing stronger the more Monaspa or Knight-line unit are around them. On top of that, their cavalry take up less population space with their Imperial Age technology, allowing them to flood the enemy. Their defenses are solid, having all defensive upgrades available except Heated Shot and Bombard Tower, and their Castle Age unique technology not only increases the attack for their Castles and towers, but allow their towers to deal pass-through damage akin to the Scorpion line. Additionally, it takes less resources for the Georgians to repair buildings thanks to their team bonus. Their siege is strong, having all of the important siege upgrades except Bombard Cannon, and their infantry have all of the upgrades they need. Their Monks are also a solid option for them, with Atonement and Illumination they only technologies they miss out on.

Despite their strengths, the Georgians have noticeable weaknesses. Their Archery Range is mediocre, lacking Arbalesters, Thumb Ring, and Ring Archer Armor, which leaves their Hand Cannoneers and sub-optimal Heavy Cavalry Archers with Parthian Tactics their only reliable ranged units. Additionally, their navy is flat out terrible, missing several key technologies across the board.

Overall, while the Georgians require a high skill-level due to their unusual start, they are a consistent civilization in all stages of the game (including a strong late-game Deathball with their Monaspa, Cavalier, siege weapons, and Keeps with Svan Towers) and are flexible in different map types from open maps like Arabia, to closed maps like Black Forest and Arena. They can opt for a Scout and Knight rush strategy thanks to their cavalry regenerating hit points, or go for a turtle and boom strategy, thanks to their Fortified Churches and starting with a free Mule Cart.

Bagrat III: Bagrat III (Georgian: ბაგრატ III) (c. 960 – 7 May 1014) was King of Abkhazia 978 onward (as Bagrat II) and King of Georgia from 1008 on. He united these two titles by dynastic inheritance and, through conquest and diplomacy, added more lands to his realm, effectively becoming the first king of the Kingdom of Georgia.

Giorgi I: He was the king of Georgia from 1014 until his death in 1027.

Demetrius: Demetriys I of Georgia was the King of Georgia from 1125 to 1156. He was also known as a poet.

Gregorios Pakourianos: He was a Byzantine politician and military commander. He was the founder of the Monastery of the Mother of God Petritzonitissa in Bachkovo.

David the Builder: David IV (reigned 1089-1125), also called Davit IV Aghmashenebeli, was the fifth King of united Georgia, he is often considered the greatest of the rulers of Georgia and set the foundation for the Georgian Golden Age which would blossom under his great-granddaughter Tamar. He defeated the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Didgori while expanding the realm and carrying out reforms of the country, including setting up the Monaspa elite corps.

Tamar the Great: One of the only two female monarchs of Georgia, Queen Tamar ruled over Georgia during its golden age where its military power, development, architecture, and arts such as poetry, painting, and literature flourished. This has led to her status as a highly idealized figure in Georgian history and popular culture.

David Soslan: He was a prince from Alania and the second husband of Queen Tamar, and was known for his military successes against Georgia's neighbouring Muslim states.

Rusudan: One of the only two female monarchs of Georgia, she ruled from 1223 to 1245.

Giorgi the Brilliant: George V the Brilliant (1286/1289–1346) was King of Georgia from 1299 to 1302 and again from 1314 until his death in 1346. He recovered Georgia from a century of Mongol domination, restoring the country's previous strength and Christian culture.

David the Elder: David VII of Georgia, also called David Ulugh (1215–1270), was king of Georgia from 1247 to 1270. He served his Mongol overlords and unsuccessfully tried to break free of their control, eventually making peace and resubmitting. The kingdom declined further during his reign under Mongol dominance.

Vakhtang: Several kings with the name of Vakhtang (which derives from a phrase in ancient Persian meaning "wolf-bodied") ruled Georgia during the medieval era.

Michael I: King of the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti from 1327 to 1329.

Alexander I: He was king of Georgia from 1412 to 1442, and the last ruler of a united Georgia, which finally collapsed and fragmented due to the destruction caused by the earlier Turco-Mongol and Timur's invasions.

Constantine: Constantine I was King of Georgia from 1405 or 1407 until his death in 1412.

History[]

“ During the early medieval period, the regions south of the Caucasus Mountains were divided among numerous petty kingdoms that eluded foreign dominance largely through geographical isolation. Although the Byzantine Empire occasionally attempted to extend its influence into these polities, no significant lasting gains were made. However, the constant threat of foreign invasion catalyzed a gradual shift towards unity. In the early 11th century, Bagrat III finally succeeded in gathering these formerly squabbling states into the Kingdom of Georgia. Despite prior tensions, the young Georgian kingdom and the Byzantine Empire made common cause when the Seljuk Turks poured into the regions south of the Caucasus, threatening both realms. Although the Byzantines suffered a catastrophic defeat at Manzikert in 1071 and abandoned many of their eastern possessions, the Georgian kingdom endured – albeit while suffering severe damage from the constant pillaging of its infrastructure. One particularly notable Georgian player in these conflicts was Gregorios Pakourianos, an officer who entered Byzantine service and became a high-ranking commander, eventually being placed in charge of most of the Empire's Balkan provinces. Georgia experienced a resurgence during the early 12th century under David IV the Builder, who – as his cognomen suggests – reformed Georgia's infrastructure and restored much of its political stability while increasing its military might. This trend was continued by Georgia's first ruling queen, Tamar (1160-1213), who elevated the kingdom's power to new heights. Tamar's power and aptitude was such that by the latter years of her reign she had transformed her realm from a minor kingdom threatened by its neighbors to a kingmaker on the verge of participating in future Crusades. Medieval Georgia flourished largely due to the ingenuity and resilience of its people. Adaptation to the mountainous landscape permitted the Georgian people to build a thriving and defensible economy that sat on one of the many crossroads between empires. Formidable fortifications – from mountain castles to the towers of Svaneti – protected the realm against hostile incursions, while Georgian armies used the terrain to their advantage in parrying enemy attacks and striking back shrewdly. The Georgian armies were led by the Monaspa, an elite cavalry force that directly served the ruling king or queen. Heavily armored, meticulously organized, and well trained, they were known to annihilate an enemy front line with a devastating shock charge. Georgia's golden age ended abruptly in the 13th century when successive waves of Mongols cascaded into the regions surrounding the Caucasus Mountains. Unable to hold off the invaders, the Georgians were unwillingly reduced to vassals of the Mongol khanates. Although the realm briefly recovered from this servitude under George V the Brilliant (1286-1346), further misfortune ensued as the Bubonic Plague swept through most of Europe and Asia, claiming millions of lives. Some decades later, the armies of Tamerlane flooded through Georgia on several occasions, carrying out despicable campaigns of destruction and slaughter . Limping into the 15th century, the Kingdom of Georgia finally collapsed in the face of Turkoman invasions. ”

Trivia[]

The Georgian icon is based on the Cross of Jerusalem, which can be found in the modern Flag of Georgia.

The Georgian Castle is based on Akhaltsikhe Castle. The civilization icon is also shown on banners on the Castle.

The Georgian Wonder is the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, located in Mtskheta, Georgia, which was completed in 1029 AD.

The user interface image depicts Saint Mamas riding a lion, as per his legend. The particular render is based on this specific tondo from the 14th-15th Century found in the Gelati Monastery.

The Georgians are the third civilization, after the Malay and Bengalis, to have units which take up a population space other than 1.

Tamar is the only hero available in the Scenario Editor who is themed on the Georgians.

The Georgians have technically had part of their culture in the game since The Age of Kings, since the Central European Monastery is modeled after the Gelati Monastery, a Georgian monastery built by David the Builder, a famous king who fought at the Battle of Didgori. Queen Tamar, the focus of the Georgian campaign, was also crowned at Gelati.
Despite the Central European Monastery being modeled after the Gelati Monastery and medieval Georgian architecture being very unique within the Caucasus region, the Georgians use the Mediterranean architecture set.

Despite the Bactrian Camel being native to the Northern Caucasus, the Georgians do not have access to the Camel Rider.

While the Georgians historically had a reputation for the use of heavy cavalry, they do not have access to the Paladin upgrade. This is done to balance their Imperial Age technology and their civilization bonus of hit point regeneration for their cavalry. In addition, their unique unit is supposed to represent their heavy cavalry.

The Georgians are the only Mediterranean civilization with access to Parthian Tactics. They are also the only Mediterranean civilization who lack both Dry Dock and Shipwright for their navy.

Despite the Byzantine Empire's strong influence on Georgian culture during medieval times, the Georgians have access to the Cannon Galleon instead of the Dromon.
