Characteristics[]

Unique unit[]

Ballista Elephant: Heavy cavalry siege unit.

Unique technologies[]

Tusk Swords: Battle Elephants +3 attack.

Double Crossbow: Ballista Elephants and Scorpions fire an additional bolt of half strength.

Civilization bonuses[]

No buildings are required to advance to the next age or to unlock other buildings.

Battle Elephants move 10% faster.

Farmers don't carry food but rather add it directly to the stockpile without any drop-off, but work 5% slower.

Villagers (and Kings) can garrison in Houses.

Team bonus[]

Scorpions have +1 range.

Overview[]

The Khmer are classified as an elephant and siege civilization, and they really shine in their advertised departments. Their Battle Elephants are particularly dangerous as they get a notable speed boost which, along with Husbandry, effectively addresses their greatest weakness which is the low speed (although they are still not fast enough to escape Halberdiers). Additionally, they get +3 attack out of Tusk Swords which lifts their attack to levels only the Elite War Elephant sits in. Their cavalry department in general is fairly solid, with fully upgraded Hussars and Cavaliers.

The Khmer siege weapons are excellent for one reason: their Scorpions. They get +1 range from their team bonus and another +1 from Siege Engineers for a total of 9 - enough to outrange Arbalesters, and they get a second bolt fired simultaneously (from Double Crossbow) which greatly increases their damage output. The Ballista Elephant, while lacking range and damage output, is a very durable unit that is very self-sufficient. Their navy is average, as they lack the Heavy Demolition Ship and Shipwright. Their defensive structures and Monks are likewise average. Their economy is great with their Farmers' ability to drop off food instantly.

The Khmer infantry are very weak, without Champions, Squires, Supplies, and Plate Mail Armor. Their archers are decent, but the lack of Thumb Ring can hurt.

Overall, the Khmer are a diverse civilization with both conventional and unconventional unit choices. They are very flexible when it comes to their build orders and opening up to unconventional and unpredictable strategies.

Changelog[]

Rise of the Rajas[]

With patch 5.8, the Arbalester was added to the technology tree.

Definitive Edition[]

Faith added to the technology tree.

Hussar added to the technology tree.

Shipwright removed from the technology tree.

With update 37650, Supplies was removed from their technology tree.

With update 42848:
Farmers' work rate debuff increased (3% → 5%).
Battle Elephants' speed buff decreased (15% → 10% faster).

In-game dialogue language[]

This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

Khmer units speak their namesake, an Austroasiatic language (related to the language spoken by the Vietnamese) spoken as the official language of the modern Cambodia.

Along with the Malay, Khmer is one of the few major languages of mainland Southeast Asia that is non-tonal. It also shares similarities with Malay due to Indian and Sanskrit influence (e.g. Suosdey in Khmer and Swasti in Malay).

History[]

“ Although the Khmer people had already settled in present-day Cambodia since the second millennium BC, larger polities would only emerge from the first century AD on. Along the Mekong river, the kingdom of Funan (68-550) and the kingdom of Chenla (550-802) profited greatly from trade and rice cultivation. However, it was their successor, the Khmer Empire (802-1431), that became the most powerful state during the Middle Ages in mainland Southeast Asia. A century after the kingdom of Chenla had disintegrated, a local chief from Southeast Cambodia called Jayavarman II (770-834) reunited the different polities through military conquest and marriages. Following his successful expedition, Jayavarman crowned himself God King (Deva Raja) in 802. This ritual act, inspired by Indian Hinduism and local traditions, not only marked the birth of the Khmer empire, but also legitimized the Khmer kings as manifestations of the Hindu gods Shiva or Vishnu. Successive rulers used this power to intervene in many aspects of the Khmer society: First, kings ordered largescale waterworks. Because monsoons greatly affected water levels, proper irrigation systems were essential for the widespread rice cultivation. At the same time, the government did not try to control production itself. Instead, local officials collected a levy from the traders in the marketplace, which was mainly run by women. Temples served as storage and were connected by an extensive network of roads, facilitating long-distance trade. Second, Khmer rulers funded extensive building programs as they regularly moved their capital. This relocation was often accompanied by the construction of a new state temple that acted as the center of the city and a place for worshiping the king. Angkor, one of the largest pre-industrial urban areas, consisted of seven capital cities and housed over one thousand temples. In the early twelfth century, Suryavarman II (1113-1150) constructed the most famous state temple, Angkor Wat. Today, the temple is still considered the largest religious complex in the world, testifying to the engineering and architectural skills of the Khmer. Finally, the king commanded the army. Between the ninth and fourteenth centuries, Khmer rulers continuously conducted military campaigns and conquered much of Southeast Asia. Their major enemies were the Siamese, the Vietnamese , and the Cham, who raided Angkor in 1177 and 1178. The Khmer had no standing army, but relied on appointed captains who were responsible for conscripting peasants in times of war. Aside from this large contingent of peasant infantry, the army deployed war elephants, sometimes mounted with ballistae . The Khmer not only fought other civilizations. Because kings married multiple women, disputes between different lineages often resulted in civil wars. For example, after Suryavarman I (1002-1049) had claimed the throne, he fought eight years with other contenders. Political instability was inherent to the Khmer society. However, from the fourteenth century on, civil wars became more frequent as rulers were unable to deal with other, structural problems: rice cultivation declined due to a cooling of temperature, the conversion from Hinduism to Theravada Buddhism undermined the legitimacy of kings as divine ruler, and warfare with the Siamese resulted in a continuous loss of territory. Eventually, king Ponhea Yat (1405-1463) abandoned Angkor in 1431, marking the end of the great Khmer Empire. ”

Trivia[]

The bottom left and right of the navigation bar in the user interface display an image of human face based from the statues found in Bayon Temple depicting the face of Avalokiteśvara.
This image is also used as the civilization icon of the Khmer in the Definitive Edition.

The middle of the navigation bar displays a human-bird creature based on the Garuda, commonly depicted in Angkor reliefs as a symbol of power and is similar to the national emblem of modern Thailand.

Khmer Houses can be compared to Atlantean Manors from Age of Mythology: The Titans; both can garrison Villagers. However, Manors support more population, soldiers can garrison inside and also cost some gold alongside wood.

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Khmer: Suryavarman I and Udayadityavarman I. Jayaviravarman is portrayed as a Malay prince, but he was also distantly related to the Khmer ruling family before Suryavarman's ascension.

They are the only civilization outside most Age of Empires III civilizations (Asian ones, however, need to construct Wonders) that can advance to the next Age without requirements. They also are the only civilization outside of the Age of Empires III civilizations and the Atlantean Citizens of Age of Mythology: The Titans that don't need dropsites for food produced by farms.

Until the Definitive Edition, Khmer Battle Elephants were the weakest against conversion as they did not have access to Faith.

The original Rise of the Rajas campaign scenario prologues and epilogues consistently mispronounce the name of the civilization. The Definitive Edition re-dub uses the proper pronunciation, better approximated by the spelling "K'mai" (https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/File:Pronounce_khmer.ogg).

The Khmer are the only civilization added in Rise of the Rajas that can train Hand Cannoneers. They are also the only Rise of the Rajas civilization to lack the Bombard Cannon, and to lack Supplies.
The Khmer are one of the three civilizations that have access to Parthian Tactics, but not Thumb Ring (the others being the Bengalis and Burmese). They are also the only civilization that can train Heavy Cavalry Archers without Thumb Ring, but have all other important upgrades to them.

During the beta, Khmer Villagers could use Houses as dropsites for resources, mostly due to a bug.

The Khmer are the only non-India civilization with access to more than one type of elephant unit.

Behind the scenes[]

Although the Khmer are one of the newest civilizations in Age of Empires II series, they have long been considered as the new potential addition by Ensemble Studio. During the development of The Conquerors, Khmer - along with Tibetans and Koreans - were considered as one of the new factions to represent the Far East region. Eventually, the developers picked Koreans because they were impressed with Turtle Ships and attracted by potential sales in South Korea.[2]
