“ Thousands of Seljuk Turkic riders poured out of Central Asia, thrusting into Persia and Mesopotamia during the 11th century. Challenge the mighty Byzantine Empire and battle Crusaders with mobile mounted armies, survive the Mongol onslaught, and establish the legendary Ottoman Empire. Can your vast gunpowder-wielding armies and lethal Janissaries overrun territories from the Levant to North Africa and Southeastern Europe, or will the Safavid armies and the walls of Constantinople foil them? ” —Description [1]

The Turks are a Middle Eastern[note 1] civilization in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, representing the Turkic people west of Persia/Iran (called "Turkish" people). The Turks are based on the Oghuz Turks which included various Turkic dynasties (i.e. Seljuk Empire, Sultanate of Rum, and the Ottoman Empire). They focus on gunpowder units.

The Turks also appear in Age of Empires III as the Ottomans. The Turks are also playable as a civilization in Age of Empires IV as the Ottomans as part of the free anniversary update.

Other Turkic civilizations in Age of Empires II are:

Tatars, representing the Turkic people in Central Asia.

Cumans, representing the Turkic people who lived on the Eurasian steppes between the 10th and 13th centuries.

Characteristics[]

Unique unit[]

Janissary: More powerful version of the Hand Cannoneer.

Unique technologies[]

Sipahi: Mounted archers +20 hit points.

Artillery: +2 range for Bombard Towers, Bombard Cannons, Cannon Galleons.

Civilization bonuses[]

Gunpowder units have +25% hit points.

Chemistry is free.

Gunpowder technologies are 50% cheaper.[note 2]

Gold Miners work 20% faster.

Light Cavalry and Hussar upgrades are free.

Scout Cavalry line gain +1 pierce armor.

Team bonus[]

Gunpowder units are created 25% faster.

Overview[]

The Turks are a gunpowder civilization, with some of the best in this category. They have greater range (excluding the Hand Cannoneer), are created faster, and have more hit points. Getting Chemistry for free means they are also very strong as an immediate option in the Imperial Age, giving them a strong Fast Imperial strategy.

Their mounted units are great. The Turks have a complete cavalry line-up, apart from the Paladin. Their Light Cavalry free upgrades and 1 extra pierce armor, the latter making them great against archers. Furthermore, their Cavalry Archers are among the very best thanks to Sipahi.

The Turkish navy is very good, only the Fast Fire Ship is missing. Their Monks are solid, with all Castle Age upgrades and their production being boosted by the Turk's economy bonus. Their Champions and Archers are also both decent. Their defensive structures get all upgrades, and their Bombard Towers have +2 range.

However, despite the excellent line-up of Turkish units, the Turks do have some notable weaknesses. Their lack of the Elite Skirmisher and Pikeman upgrades are two massive holes. This means that defending as the Turks requires utilizing less conventional counters, using Light Cavalry and Mangonels against Crossbowmen, and Camel Riders and Monks against Knights. Not only that, they are also arguably the worst civilization when gold supplies run out, especially when factoring in the fact that they lack the Onager. Additionally, their economy is overall below average without Crop Rotation and Stone Shaft Mining, or any economy bonus outside of their gold miner bonus, which while strong furthers their reliance on gold and their burn-out.

Overall, the Turks are a civilization that has a wide array of strong options, all tied together by their gold mining bonus. However, they are sluggish in the early game and wither when they run out of gold. They are best suited to closed maps and team-game settings, as the former can allow them to go for a Fast Castle or Fast Imperial strategy, while the latter allows them to have a constant supply of gold through Trade for their army composition.

History[]

“ The name Turk refers to two different Muslim groups of the Middle East-first the Seljuks and then the Ottomans. The Seljuks, nomads from the steppes near the Caspian Sea, converted to Islam around the tenth century. Approximately 70,000 Seljuks started as mercenaries to fill the ranks of the Islamic army of the caliph of Baghdad. These mercenaries converted to the Sunni branch of Islam. In 1055 they became the real power behind the caliph in Baghdad and began extending their rule. Their leaders took the title sultan, meaning "holders of power". By 1100 they controlled most of Anatolia (taken from the Byzantines ), Palestine, the lands surrounding the Persian Gulf, the holy cities of Arabia, and as far east as Samarkand. In 1071 the Seljuks achieved a stunning victory over a Byzantine army at Malazgirt in modern Turkey, which led to Turkish occupation of most of Anatolia. At nearly the same time, they successfully captured Jerusalem from its Egyptian Muslim rulers. These two events shocked the Byzantines, the papacy, and the Christian Europeans. The result was the Crusades, which carried on for the next 200 years. The Seljuk Turks were worn down by the recurring wars with the Crusaders, even though they were successful ultimately in regaining control of Palestine. They were threatened simultaneously by the activities of the Assassins, a heretical sect of Islam. Internally, Islam entered a period of introspection because of the popularity of Sufi mysticism. During this period of exhaustion and weakness, they were attacked suddenly by the Mongols and collapsed. Baghdad fell to the invaders in 1258 and the Seljuk Empire disappeared. Islamic peoples from Anatolia (modern Turkey in Asia Minor) were unified in the early fourteenth century under Sultan Osman I and took the name Osmanli, or Ottomans, in his honor. The Ottomans swore a jihad against the crumbling Byzantine Empire and took their campaign around Constantinople into the Balkans. In 1389 the Serbs were defeated. In 1396 a "crusader" army from Hungary was defeated. Ottoman successes were temporarily halted by the Mongols [sic] under Tamerlane , but he moved on with his army and the Ottomans recovered. Sultan Mehmed II ("the Conqueror") at last captured Constantinople on May 29, 1453. The great walls of Constantinople were battered by 70 guns for eight weeks and then 15,000 Janissaries led the successful assault. The Ottomans pushed on into Europe following the capture of Constantinople and threatened a sort of reverse Crusade. They were stopped by a Hungarian army at Belgrade in 1456, however. Attacks on Vienna were repulsed in 1529 and again in 1683. At its peak in the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire reached up into Europe to Budapest and Odessa and included all of Greece and the Balkans, the lands surrounding the Black Sea, Asia Minor, the Levant, Arabia, Egypt, and most of North Africa. The Ottoman Empire remained a significant world power until World War I in the twentieth century. ” — [1]

Trivia[]

The Turks' civilization icon is based on the flag of the Ottoman Navy.

The user interface image in the Definitive Edition displays 13th century double-headed eagle used by The Sultanate of Rum.

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the (Oghuz) Turks: Osman, Mustafa Pasha, and Selim the Grim.

The ethnonym Türk (𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰏) / Türük (𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰) originally referred to only the Göktürks. They are represented by Turks in-game but had little connection to the Oghuz Turks, which serve as the basis of the civilization. In addition, Tatars also have some of their rulers as AI player names.
The ethnonym Turks would later be used for other Turkic-speaking peoples, such as:
The Khazars, represented in-game by ethnologically unrelated Cumans;
The Toquz Oghuz (Nine Tribes) confederation, mentioned as drugu rus dgu "Turks of Nine Bones" in an 8th-century Tibetan document;
The Karakhanids, whose rulers appear as names for Tatar AI players;
The Oghuzes, from whom arose the Seljuks and Anatolian Turks (including the Ottomans), represented in-game by the Turks.
Turks was also used for various Turkmen peoples with the two terms having common origins and being interchangeable; today, Turkmens / Turkomans describe only Eastern-Oghuz speaking peoples.
Strangely, Oghuz Yabgu, Qara Qoyunlu, and Aq Qoyunlu polities, though historically Oghuz-speaking, are represented by the unrelated, Chagatai-speaking Tatars, either as AI player names for the Tatars or by being depicted as Tatars in-game in case of the Turkomen. This is potentially because these peoples were left out of the original Turks design, which focused on the Seljuks and the Ottomans.
All this could also have stemmed from developers' oversight: even if the in-game Tatars and Cumans were supposed to also represent the 'less Persianate, less Islamized' Turkic polities, Tatars' and Cumans' in-game architectural set is Persianate (though topped with Timurid fluted domes).

Despite the Turks being based on the Seljuk Turks and other Oghuz Turkish empires (all of whom were once a nomadic people), they do not get Steppe Lancers, possibly for gameplay balance purposes.

The Scenario Editor building Mosque is identical to the Turkish Wonder.

When the Turks are given other gunpowder units in the Scenario Editor, the hit point bonus does not apply to any gunpowder unit which the Turks cannot normally train, except the Houfnice.
