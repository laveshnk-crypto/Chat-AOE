“ Charlemagne's empire has fallen, and the task of rebuilding the Holy Roman Empire lies in your hands. Unite the feuding duchies, contend with Papal authority, and construct powerful crenellated fortifications! Smash enemy armies with potent knights and demolish their cities with armored siege engines, or lead your men on crusade to the Holy Land or into Eastern Europe. The Teuton unique unit is the Teutonic Knight, a zealous warrior who can carve most melee units into ribbons. ” —Description [1]

The Teutons are a Central European civilization in Age of Empires II. They are based on Medieval Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, as well as on medieval Christian military orders, such as the Teutonic Knights. They focus on infantry, with support from cavalry, siege units, and fortifications.

The Teutons also appear in Age of Empires III and Age of Empires IV as Germans and the Holy Roman Empire, respectively. In both installments, they share the same characteristic of the Teutons of being an infantry-focused civilization with a strong economy and defensive capacity.

Characteristics[]

Unique unit[]

Teutonic Knight: Slow but strong infantry.

Unique technologies[]

Ironclad: Gives siege weapons +4 melee armor.

Crenellations: Gives Castles +3 range and makes garrisoned infantry shoot arrows.

Civilization bonuses[]

Monks have double healing range.

Towers garrison twice as many units.

Murder Holes and Herbal Medicine are free.

Farms are 40% cheaper.

Town Centers can garrison +10 units.

Barracks and Stable units receive +1/+2 melee armor in the Castle/Imperial Age.

Team bonus[]

Units resist conversion (half as effective as Faith).

Overview[]

The Teutons are built around a slow but powerful force. The most indicative part of this is their unique unit, the Teutonic Knight, a unit that has poor movement speed but has extremely high melee armor as well as high attack and high health. Outside of this, their Barracks and Stable units receive an extra +1/+2 melee armor in the Castle and Imperial ages, and they possess all of the infantry upgrades available. Their siege weapons are also great, as they are missing only the Siege Ram and have Ironclad, which helps patch up their main weakness: melee attacks. Teutonic Monks are excellent, with every upgrade and doubled healing range. Defensively, they have additional garrison capacity in their Town Centers and Towers, giving them an increased ability to protect their Villagers from raiding. Crenellations is another big edge to their defensive capabilities, as it allows their Castles to fire back at Bombard Cannons, normally a major threat. Lastly, their economy is very powerful during the mid-game with their 40% cheaper farms, as it greatly reduces the amount of wood production required to sustain a farming economy, freeing resources to be used elsewhere.

However, the Teutons have several notable weaknesses. Their cavalry are limited to the Knight line, as their Scout Cavalry lack the Light Cavalry upgrade. This means they lose out on an important raiding unit and anti-monk unit. additionally, they lack Husbandry, so their Knights can struggle to force fights and use their melee armor. Their archers are very weak, missing improvements all over the board, leaving Hand Cannoneers as their only viable Archery Range unit. The Teutonic navy is very underwhelming without Dry Dock and Bracer, which is an unfortunate combination as both the Fire Ship and Galleon are greatly hindered by their absence. They have no early game economy bonus, which means that they are very vulnerable to early pressure even with their defensive bonuses. Lastly, the combination of poor Skirmishers and poor Scout Cavalry means that they have few good options when running low on gold.

Overall, the Teutons are a slow but formidable civilization with a variety of strong options, as long as gold is not in short supply. They are particularly strong on closed maps like Arena where they can get to their strongest options without having to worry about their early game.

In-game dialogue language[]

In-game, Teutonic units speak Old and Middle High German, which are the ancestor languages of modern Standard German (i.e. Hochdeutsch) and several dialects of it (e.g. Bavarian, Swabian, Transylvanian Saxon, Zipser German, etc.). They were spoken in present-day Germany as well as in Central Europe and parts of Eastern Europe (e.g. Transylvania) roughly between 700 and 1350, so this corresponds well to the time period depicted in the game. The Goths speak the same language in-game, but actually, the Goths had their own Gothic language which was spoken as early as the 4th century and became extinct by the 8th or 9th century. Crimean Gothic continued to be spoken until the late 18th century, but it went extinct as well during the aforementioned time.

History[]

“ The origin of Germany traces back to the crowning of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor in 800. Upon his death the empire was split into three parts that gradually coalesced into two: the western Frankish kingdom that became France and the eastern kingdom that became Germany. The title of Holy Roman Emperor remained in Charlemagne's family until the tenth century when they died out. In 919 Henry, Duke of Saxony, was elected king of Germany by his fellow dukes. His son Otto became emperor in 962. The Holy Roman Empire that Otto I controlled extended over the German plain north to the Baltic, eastward into parts of modern Poland , and southward through modern Switzerland, modern Austria, and northern Italy . From the outset, the emperors had a difficult problem keeping control of two disparate regions-Germany and Italy-that were separated by the Alps. The Holy Roman Empire was successful at first because it benefited the principal members, Germany and Italy. The Germans were not far removed from the barbarian condition. They had been conquered by Charlemagne only a century earlier. They benefited greatly from Italian culture, technology, and trade. The Italians welcomed the relative peace and stability the empire ensured. Italy had been invaded time and again for the previous 500 years. The protection of the empire defended the papacy and allowed the city-states of Italy to begin their growth. The imperial armies were manned partially by tenants of church lands who owed service to the emperor. A second important contingent were the ministriales, a corps of serfs who received the best training and equipment as knights but who were not free men. These armies were used to put down revolts or interference by local nobles and peasants or to defend against raids by Vikings from the north and Magyars from the east. Because Germany remained a collection of independent principalities in competition, German warriors became very skilled. The most renowned German soldiers were the Teutonic Knights , a religious order of warriors inspired by the Crusades. The Teutonic Knights spread Christianity into the Baltic region by conquest but were eventually halted by Alexander Nevsky at the battle on frozen Lake Peipus. A confrontation between the emperors and the church over investiture of bishops weakened the emperors in both Germany and Italy. During periods of temporary excommunication of the emperor and outright war against Rome, imperial authority lapsed. The local German princes solidified their holdings or fought off the Vikings with no interference or help from the emperor. In Italy, the rising city-states combined to form the Lombard League and refused to recognize the emperor. Political power in both Germany and Italy shifted from the emperor to the local princes and cities. The ministriales rebelled, taking control of the cities and castles they garrisoned and declaring themselves free. During desperate attempts to regain Italy, more concessions were given to the local princes in Germany. By the middle of the thirteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire existed in name only. The throne remained empty for 20 years. The German princes cared only about their own holdings. The Italian city-states did not want a German ruler and were strong enough to defend themselves. Future emperors in the Middle Ages were elected by the German princes but they ruled in name only, controlling little more than their own family estates. Germany remained a minor power in Europe for centuries to come. [1] ” —In-game history section

The historical Teutons were first mentioned by Republican Roman authors as being from Scandinavia and allies with the Cimbri against Rome. The in-game "Teutons" actually represent many migration period's West Germanic-speaking peoples, East Francia, the Holy Roman Empire, Crusader states, and three famous crusading orders: the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and the Teutonic Knights.

Trivia[]

The Teutons' civilization icon is based on the Reichsadler of Henry VII and Louis IV in the 12th century.

The user interface image in the Definitive Edition displays a globus cruciger, the Imperial Orb of the Holy Roman Empire called Reichsapfel, part of the Imperial Regalia.

Like the Saracens generally representing the Islamic factions (before the introduction of the Berbers), the Teutons, alongside the Franks, generally represent the Christian factions.

Their unique unit, the Teutonic Knight, was a group of soldiers of the Teutonic Order, who participated in the Northern Crusades against many pagan nations of the Baltic Sea, especially the Lithuanians. They later fought other Christian nations as well, particularly Poland.

Except for Native American civilizations, the Teutons are the only civilization in Age of Empires II that do not have access to Light Cavalry.

Ever since The Age of Kings, the Teutons get all three of the rarest upgrades (the Siege Onager, Paladin, and Bombard Tower).

In the Definitive Edition, the Teutons have the largest number of civilization bonuses, with 6.

The Teutons and the Goths are the first civilizations with the same language lines.

The Byzantines and the Teutons are the only "defensive" civilizations in The Age Of Kings.

The Teutons' playstyle focuses around slow but armored units with high resistance against conversion, which closely resembles the Macedonians from Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome which play similarly.

The Teutons and Franks are the only two civilizations that have access to Paladin, but not Hussar, signifying that they focus on heavy cavalry.

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Teutons: Emperor in a Barrel, Frederick Barbarossa, Henry the Lion, Emperor Sigismund, and Ulrich von Jungingen.

The Teutons are mostly antagonist for the Dawn of the Dukes campaigns.

Before the buffs introduced in updates 35584 and 36906, the Teutons were one of the most underplayed civilizations, mostly on open maps like Arabia, due to their very limited military options. Their cavalry lacks mobility due to the absence of Husbandry and the Teutonic Knight is also slow. The extra melee armor for both Barracks and Stable units allowed them to gain a strong identity as the slow civilization with focus on melee combat, thus giving more reasons to be picked on open maps, while also setting them as among the strongest for closed maps like Arena and Black Forest.
