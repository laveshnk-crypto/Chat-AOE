“ After the Berbers demolished the Visigoth kingdom of Iberia, the last remnants of resistance took up arms in the mountains of Asturias and strove to slowly turn the tide. Launch the Reconquista, lead deadly galleons of Conquistadors overseas to explore and conquer unknown lands, and experience the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition. From the tyranny of Pedro the Cruel to the heroism and tolerance of El Cid, the path to follow is yours to choose. ” —Description [1]

The Spanish are a Mediterranean European civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They are the descendants of the Celtiberians, the Romans, and the Visigoths, and are closely related to the Portuguese, who likewise base their homeland in the Iberian peninsula. The Spanish focus on gunpowder units and Monks.

The Spanish also appear as a playable civilization in Age of Empires III. Similar to their predecessor, the Spanish in Age of Empires III have a well-rounded tech tree with a lackluster economy, although the Spanish in Age of Empires III put more emphasis on rush strategies, while the Spanish in Age of Empires II are a more late-game oriented civilization with a lackluster early game.

Overview[]

The Spanish are classified as a gunpowder and Monk civilization. Their gunpowder units have a faster firing rate on their Hand Cannoneers, Bombard Cannons, and Cannon Galleons. Their Monks have every upgrade available, as well as Inquisition to speed up their conversions, and their Missionary is faster than a Monk. Their infantry and cavalry units are great and do not miss out on a single upgrade. They also have fully upgraded Elite Skirmishers and are the only civilization where every single trash unit is fully upgraded.

In the early Castle Age, the Conquistador is an extremely threatening unit thanks to its high damage output and fast mobility. The Spanish navy is excellent, with a perfect technology tree shared only with the Byzantines. Their Cannon Galleons have faster firing and more accurate cannonballs, although their high cost will limit their usability. Defensively, the Spanish are strong, lacking only Heated Shot, and they have Supremacy, which makes their Villagers much harder to raid. Lastly, they have a civilization bonus that grants them 20 gold with every technology they research, facilitating their technological progress.

However, the Spanish have weaknesses as well. Their archers are very poor because they lack the Crossbowmen upgrade. Despite their faster-firing Bombard Cannons, their siege weapons are overall below average, without Siege Engineers, Heavy Scorpion, or Siege Onager. Their economy is poor, thanks to no real early-game bonus. Combined with their military bonuses only applying in the Imperial Age, and the complete lack of the Crossbowmen, they are one of the weakest civilizations during the early game.

Overall, the Spanish have a reasonably broad tech tree that enables them to pick from a wide variety of viable strategies. The Spanish technology tree and unique units give them a wide variety of strong units in the mid and late game. Much like the Portuguese, the Spanish have several bonuses that allow them to save and accumulate gold. However, their slow start and lack of Crossbowmen cause them to struggle on most maps in a 1v1 game, often relying on their Conquistador.

Pelagius is credited with initiating the Reconquista, the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors, and establishing the Asturian monarchy, making him the forefather of all the future Iberian monarchies, including the Kings of Castile, the Kings of León, and the Kings of Portugal.

Queen Isabella  (1451–1504): Queen of Castile from 1474–1504. Ruled jointly with her husband, Ferdinand II or Aragon, forming the basis for Spanish unification.

History[]

“ The history of Spain in the Middle Ages is written in three principal chapters: the creation of Visigothic Spain, then Muslim Spain, and then Reconquista, the reconquest of Spain by Christians. The Iberian peninsula was an appendage of the Roman Empire that was discarded as the empire disintegrated because it could not be defended in the face of barbarian invasions that brought devastation to the streets of Rome itself. The peninsula was occupied in large part by one of the migrating barbarian groups, the Visigoths, who had come most recently from the southwestern plains of modern Russia, displaced by the Huns . The Visigoths became Christian and occupied the center of the peninsula for several centuries. When one of the Visigoth lords appealed to Muslims in North Africa in the 8th century for aid against the king, the door was opened for Muslim expansion across the Straits of Gibraltar. Within 50 years the Muslims had taken most of the peninsula, leaving only small areas in the mountains and to the north outside their control. Muslim, or Moorish, Spain quickly developed into one of the most advanced European civilizations of the Middle Ages. It prospered in relative peace thanks to good agriculture, trade, coinage, and industry. It benefited from the spread of learning throughout the Muslim world. Cordoba became the largest and most sophisticated city in Europe after Constantinople, featuring a population of over 500,000, wonderful architecture, great works of art, a fabulous library, and important centers of learning. Peace and prosperity were disrupted by internal disruption, however, as important local rulers competed for overall power, and by external attack, both from the Christian north and Muslim North Africa. By the middle of the 13th century, Muslim Spain was reduced to a single kingdom centered on Granada. The Christian kingdoms of the north gradually ate away at Muslim power, though their effort was often dispersed when they fought with each other. Portugal split off and created a separate kingdom. Muslim Granada survived for several centuries thanks to liberal tribute paid to the Christians to its north and to clever diplomacy that played their enemies against each other. In 1469, however, Isabel I of Castile married Fernando II of Aragon, uniting the two competing Christian kingdoms and foreshadowing the end of Muslim Spain. Spain of the Middle Ages was a world of contrasts. It featured the great advantages of a multi-ethnic society, merging Latin, Jewish, Christian, Arab , and Muslim influences into a unique and rich culture. At the same time, however, many of these same cultural forces clashed violently. When two different cultures clash, the result is often grim. The reconquest dragged on for eight centuries, mirroring the Crusades in the holy land and creating an atmosphere that became increasingly pitiless and intolerant. The Christian warriors who eventually expelled the Muslims earned a reputation for being among the best fighters in Europe. Granada fell to the forces of Aragon and Castile at the start of 1492, a momentous year, as under the patronage of Queen Isabel, Christopher Columbus subsequently discovered for Europeans the great continents of the New World and their native populations. ” —Description [1]

Trivia[]

The Spanish's civilization icon is based on the coat of arms of the Crown of Castile which represents the Kingdoms of Leon and Castile.

Before the Definitive Edition user interface image displayed the lion from the Shield of León.

The Morion helmet worn by the Conquistador is used as The Conquerors icon and is also displayed on the user interface image in the Definitive Edition.

Originally, the unique unit of the Spanish was planned to be the Genitour, but it was replaced by the Conquistador before release.

The Spanish Wonder, the Torre del Oro, was actually built by the Berber Almohad Caliphate, colloquially known as the 'Moors' and only fell into Spanish hands after the capture of Seville during the Reconquista.

Together with the Bulgarians, the Spanish are the only civilization to lack access to the Crossbowman upgrade.
The Crossbowman's absence is made for gameplay consideration; historically, the Castilian and Aragonese armies did deploy crossbowmen.
Inconsistently, the Age of Empires III equivalent of this unit is available to Spanish.

The following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Spanish: El Cid, El Cid Campeador, Gonzalo Pizarro, King Alfonso, King Sancho, and Francisco de Orellana.

One of the Spanish AI player names, Queen Isabella, reappears as the Spanish personality of Age of Empires III .

The Spanish are the only civilization with complete upgrades to their "trash units" (Halberdier, Hussar and Elite Skirmisher), making them a strong civilization when the gold is scarce.

This is the second Romance-speaking civilization added to The Age of Kings, after their cousins the Franks.

In contrast to their neighbor, the Portuguese, the Spanish put more emphasis on a mobile army and Monks. This is reflected with the Spanish having access to Paladin and Hussar upgrades, their unique mounted Monk unit, and their mounted gunpowder unique unit, but have lackluster foot archers (being one of the two civilizations to lack the Crossbowman upgrade).

Before the Definitive Edition, the Spanish were the only Western European civilization with Bloodlines and Thumb Ring. After they became a Mediterranean civilization, none of the Western European civilization have either technology.
